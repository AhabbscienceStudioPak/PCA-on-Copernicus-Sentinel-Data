# PCA on Copernicus Sentinel Data
Earth observation satellites employ various camera types to capture images of the Earth's land cover. A commonly used camera in this field is the multispectral camera, which captures multispectral images of different Earth locations. Multispectral images share similarities with regular colored images used in our daily lives. However, unlike typical color images that have only three frequencies/spectral bands (Red, Green, and Blue), multispectral images typically consist of a more extensive range of bands, usually between 6 to 30. This increased number of bands allows for improved differentiation between various land cover types (such as crops, forests, water, and land) compared to using only regular colored/RGB images.

Copernicus, administered by the European Union (EU), stands out as one of the world's largest earth observation programs. It utilizes Sentinel satellites to capture Earth images at different wavelengths from space. Similarly, Landsat, a program operated by the US government, serves a comparable purpose.
